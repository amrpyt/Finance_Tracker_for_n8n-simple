## Introduction

This document outlines the complete system architecture for the **Personal Finance Tracker Telegram Bot**, a conversational AI-powered financial assistant that enables Arabic and English-speaking users to track expenses, income, accounts, and loans through natural language interaction in Telegram.

The architecture leverages a **Convex-only serverless approach** combining:
- **Telegram Bot API** for user interaction
- **Convex** as the serverless backend platform (database + functions)
- **Rork Toolkit API** for AI-powered natural language understanding


This design prioritizes **sub-2-second response times**, **85%+ AI accuracy**, and **zero-friction user experience** while operating within Convex free tier constraints for initial deployment.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** Greenfield project - No starter template

This is a new implementation built from scratch. The architecture is optimized for:
- Telegram Bot API integration
- Convex serverless backend
- Rork Toolkit AI integration (not OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Bilingual support (Arabic/English)

---

## Technical Summary

The system implements a **pure Convex serverless architecture** where the Convex HTTP Action receives Telegram webhook events directly, and Convex Actions execute all business logic, data operations, and AI processing. There is no separate bot server. Convex provides the real-time database, serverless compute, and orchestrates calls to the Rork Toolkit API for natural language understanding. This architecture achieves sub-2-second response times with fast webhook acknowledgment (<200ms), minimizes infrastructure management, and scales automatically within Convex's generous free tier (1M function calls/month). The conversational interface requires no forms or buttons‚Äîusers interact purely through natural language messages, with AI extracting transaction details and presenting them for confirmation before committing to the database.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Convex Cloud (serverless-only)

**Key Services:**
- **Convex**: Serverless backend, real-time database, TypeScript functions, HTTP actions
- **Telegram Bot API**: User interface and messaging
- **Rork Toolkit API**: AI/LLM for natural language processing
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline

**Deployment Host and Regions:**
- Convex: Auto-deployed to global edge network
- Telegram: Global CDN (managed by Telegram)

**Rationale:** This combination provides:
- Zero database management (Convex handles it)
- Automatic scaling and real-time capabilities
- Free tier sufficient for 100-1000 users
- Simple deployment pipeline
- Sub-2-second response times through edge deployment and direct Convex processing

---

## Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo with workspace-based organization

**Monorepo Tool:** npm workspaces (lightweight, no additional tooling needed)

**Package Organization:**
```
/bot          - Legacy bot server (inactive; retained for reference)
/convex       - Convex backend functions and schema
/shared       - Shared TypeScript types and utilities
```

**Rationale:** Simple monorepo structure allows code sharing (especially TypeScript interfaces) between bot and Convex functions while keeping deployment boundaries clear. npm workspaces provide sufficient tooling without complexity of Turborepo/Nx.

## Architectural Patterns

- **Serverless Architecture:** Convex functions execute on-demand with automatic scaling - _Rationale:_ Zero infrastructure management, pay-per-use pricing, automatic scaling for variable load
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Telegram webhooks trigger Convex HTTP Action, which invokes Convex Actions - _Rationale:_ Loose coupling, asynchronous processing, resilient to failures
- **Repository Pattern:** Convex functions abstract database operations - _Rationale:_ Testable business logic, consistent data access patterns
- **Function Calling Pattern:** Rork AI uses function calling to route user intents to appropriate Convex mutations/queries - _Rationale:_ Structured AI responses, deterministic action execution
- **Confirmation Pattern:** AI extracts intent ‚Üí Present to user ‚Üí User confirms ‚Üí Execute action - _Rationale:_ Prevents errors from AI misinterpretation, builds user trust
- **Optimistic Updates:** Balance updates calculated immediately after transaction confirmation - _Rationale:_ Instant feedback, perceived performance improvement
