- ✅ Technical constraints satisfied (Convex, Rork API, TypeScript, bilingual support)
- ✅ All 5 epics have corresponding architectural components
- ✅ User journeys supported through bot handlers and Convex functions

**Evidence:**
- Epic 1 (Foundation) → Bot server + Convex integration architecture
- Epic 2 (Accounts) → Account data model + CRUD functions
- Epic 3 (Transactions) → AI integration + transaction management
- Epic 4 (Loans) → Loan tracking data model + payment logic
- Epic 5 (History) → Query functions + search capabilities

**Concerns:** None

---

### 2. Architecture Fundamentals: **95% PASS** ✅

**Pass Rate:** 19/20 items (95%)

**Analysis:**

## Risk Assessment

### Top 5 Risks (By Severity)

#### 1. **Rork API Dependency** - MEDIUM RISK ⚠️

**Description:** Single point of failure for AI functionality. If Rork API is down or slow, core features break.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Already implemented: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Already implemented: Timeout handling (5s max)
- 🔧 **Recommended:** Add circuit breaker pattern (stop calling after N consecutive failures)
- 🔧 **Recommended:** Implement fallback to rule-based parsing for simple transactions (e.g., regex for "paid 50 for coffee")

**Timeline Impact:** 1-2 days to implement circuit breaker and basic fallback

---

#### 2. **Rate Limiting Enforcement** - LOW RISK ✅

**Description:** In-memory rate limiting in bot server could be bypassed if multiple bot instances deployed.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Already addressed: Single bot instance sufficient for MVP (100-1000 users)
- 🔧 **Future:** Move rate limiting to Convex functions for multi-instance deployments
- 🔧 **Future:** Use Redis for distributed rate limiting if scaling beyond single instance

**Timeline Impact:** Not critical for MVP, 1 day to implement if needed

---

#### 3. **AI Accuracy Measurement** - LOW RISK ✅

**Description:** No automated way to measure 85% AI accuracy target from NFR2.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Already implemented: Logging of all AI calls for manual review
- 🔧 **Recommended:** Create admin dashboard to review AI extractions vs user confirmations
- 🔧 **Recommended:** Track "user corrected AI extraction" events

**Timeline Impact:** 2-3 days to build accuracy tracking dashboard (post-MVP)

---

#### 4. **Session State Loss** - LOW RISK ✅

**Description:** In-memory session storage means pending confirmations lost on bot server restart.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Acceptable for MVP: Users can simply retry their message
- ✅ Already implemented: Session timeout (confirmations expire after reasonable time)
- 🔧 **Future:** Persist pending confirmations to Convex if needed

**Timeline Impact:** Not critical, 1 day to implement if user feedback indicates issue

---

#### 5. **Convex Free Tier Limits** - LOW RISK ✅

**Description:** 1M function calls/month could be exceeded with high user activity.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Already addressed: Architecture designed for free tier (documented in NFR7)
- ✅ Monitoring in place: Convex Dashboard shows usage
- 🔧 **Recommended:** Set up alerts at 80% of free tier limit
- 🔧 **Plan:** Upgrade to paid tier ($25/month) if approaching limit

**Timeline Impact:** No development needed, monitoring only

---

## Recommendations

### Must-Fix Before Development: **NONE** ✅

All critical items are addressed. Architecture is ready for implementation.

---

### Should-Fix for Better Quality

#### 1. Add Circuit Breaker for Rork API (Priority: HIGH)

**Location:** `convex/lib/rork.ts`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
class RorkCircuitBreaker {
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime = 0;
  private state: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open' = 'closed';
  
  async call<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'open') {
      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailureTime > 60000) {
        this.state = 'half-open';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker open - Rork API unavailable');
      }
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await fn();
      this.reset();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.recordFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  private recordFailure() {
    this.failureCount++;
    this.lastFailureTime = Date.now();
    if (this.failureCount >= 5) {
      this.state = 'open';
    }
  }
  
  private reset() {
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.state = 'closed';
  }
}
```

**Benefit:** Prevents cascading failures, faster error responses when Rork is down

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 2. Define Alerting Thresholds (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Location:** `docs/architecture/monitoring.md` (new file)

**Content:**
```markdown
## Alerting Thresholds

### Critical Alerts (Page on-call)
- Error rate > 10% over 5 minutes
- Convex function execution time > 5s (p95)
- Bot server down (health check fails 3 times)

### Warning Alerts (Slack notification)
- Error rate > 5% over 15 minutes
- AI API latency > 3s (p95)
- Convex free tier usage > 80%
- Rate limit rejections > 100/hour

### Info Alerts (Dashboard only)
- Daily active users milestone (100, 500, 1000)
- Transaction volume spike (2x normal)
```

**Benefit:** Proactive issue detection, clear escalation

**Effort:** 1 hour documentation + 2 hours implementation

---

#### 3. Add Request Correlation IDs (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Location:** `bot/src/utils/logger.ts` and `convex/lib/logger.ts`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Generate correlation ID for each user message
const correlationId = `${userId}-${Date.now()}-${randomUUID()}`;

// Pass through all layers
logger.info("Processing message", { correlationId, userId });
await convex.action(api.ai.processUserMessage, { correlationId, ... });

// In Convex:
console.log(JSON.stringify({ correlationId, action: "calling_rork_api" }));
```

**Benefit:** Trace requests across bot → Convex → Rork for debugging

**Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

### Nice-to-Have Improvements

#### 1. Add Webhook Signature Validation (Priority: LOW)

**Benefit:** Extra security layer for Telegram webhooks

**Effort:** 1-2 hours

---

#### 2. Create Admin Dashboard for AI Accuracy (Priority: LOW)

**Benefit:** Track AI performance against 85% accuracy target

**Effort:** 1 day (post-MVP)

---

#### 3. Implement Fallback Rule-Based Parser (Priority: LOW)

**Benefit:** Basic functionality if Rork API unavailable

**Effort:** 1 day

---
