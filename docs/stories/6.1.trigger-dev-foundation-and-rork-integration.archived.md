# 6.1 Trigger.dev Foundation & RORK Integration

**⚠️ ARCHIVED & SUPERSEDED ⚠️**

**This story documents the initial implementation of the Trigger.dev architecture from Epic 6. This approach was later simplified and replaced by the Convex-only architecture in Epic 7. This file is retained for historical reference only.**

---

Status: Ready for Review

## Implementation Status

- **Task 1**: Create trigger.config.ts with project ref and task directories
- **Task 2**: Implement health:ping task for sanity check
- **Task 3**: Implement rork:test task with retry logic

## Task 2: Deployment and Validation

- **Task 5**: Deploy to production and validate task execution
- **Task 6**: Update project documentation

## Agent Model Used
GPT-4 (Cascade)

## Debug Log References

- Local dev server: Working - tasks visible and executable
- Production deployment: Version 20251003.2 deployed successfully
- Task execution: Both health:ping and rork:test tasks working in dev and prod
- RORK API connectivity: Validated connectivity to free RORK API endpoint

## Completion Notes

1. **Trigger.dev Foundation**: Successfully established with project `proj_xjxlcyltnccogwcsxiir`
2. **Task Implementation**: Created 2 initial tasks with proper retry strategies
3. **RORK Integration**: Validated connectivity to free RORK API endpoint
4. **Environment Setup**: Configured proper environment variables
5. **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to production environment

### Change Log

- **2025-10-03**: Initial Trigger.dev setup and configuration
- **2025-10-03**: Implemented health:ping and rork:test tasks
- **2025-10-03**: Successfully deployed to production (version 20251003.2)
- **2025-10-03**: Validated task execution and RORK connectivity

## Objective
Establish Trigger.dev in the repo with clean configuration and validate connectivity and error-handling with RORK. Create initial tasks, environment variables, and deployment flow (staging → production).

## Problem / Context
{{ ... }}
  - Enable console logging for dev.
- Ensure TypeScript includes `trigger.config.ts` in `tsconfig.json`.
- Define initial tasks:
  - `health:ping` (sanity check, returns OK).
  - `rork:test` calling RORK with `retry.onThrow()` handling 429 and network errors; tag runs `rork`.
- **Task 3.1**: Verify task execution in Trigger.dev dashboard

## QA Gates
- **Idempotency**: Ensure tasks are safe to retry

## Acceptance Criteria
- `trigger.config.ts` present with project ref and task dirs; visible in logs during dev.
- Tasks `health:ping` and `rork:test` are deployable and runnable from dashboard.
- RORK request uses retry strategy and respects rate limits; errors visible with traces.
- Env vars present in Trigger.dev; tasks read them via `process.env.*`.
- CI or manual deploy documented; preview branches optional but documented.
- Evidence: screenshots or run URLs linked in PR.

## QA Gates
- Task runs succeed in staging with deterministic output.
- Forced network failure triggers retry logic and then fails gracefully.
- **Logging**: All task runs logged with clear inputs/outputs

## Out of Scope
- Telegram webhook handling.
- Complex business logic

## Dev Notesion.

## Notes / References
- Trigger.dev: tasks, retries, environment variables, versioning, deployment, context.
