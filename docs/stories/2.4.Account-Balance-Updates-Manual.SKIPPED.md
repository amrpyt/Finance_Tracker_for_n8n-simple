# Story 2.4: Account Balance Updates (Manual) â€” SKIPPED

Status: SKIPPED (2025-10-02)

## Rationale
- Manual balance overrides conflict with the AI-first, no-manual-actions policy.
- Data integrity and auditability risks; prefer corrections via explicit transaction adjustments.
- Simpler UX and reduced error surface area.
- Focus scope on AI-driven flows (Story 2.5 balance check, Epic 3 transactions) to influence balances.

## Impact
- Manual balance mutation path removed from MVP scope.
- All balance changes should be the result of transactions (expense/income) or system adjustments with audit trail.
- Keep acceptance criteria in PRD for historical context; marked as SKIPPED.
