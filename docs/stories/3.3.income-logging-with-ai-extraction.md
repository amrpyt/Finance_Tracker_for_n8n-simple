## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to type "received salary 5000" and have it logged as income,  
**so that** I can track all money coming in.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Bot detects income intent from keywords like "received", "earned", "ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÑŸÖÿ™", "ÿ≠ÿµŸÑÿ™ ÿπŸÑŸâ" [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
2. AI extracts amount and description from user message [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
3. Bot presents extracted income details for confirmation (e.g., "üí∞ Income: 5000 EGP for 'salary' to Main Bank. Confirm?") [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
4. On confirmation, transaction saved with type='income' and account balance incremented [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
5. Confirmation message includes updated balance [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
6. Income transactions distinguished from expenses in database and future queries [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
7. Handles edge cases: missing amount (prompts user), ambiguous description (asks for clarification) [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- **Story 3.1** successfully implemented the Rork API integration layer with `processUserMessage` action that returns structured AI responses with intent, entities, confidence, and nextAction. [`docs/stories/3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md`](./3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md)
- **Story 3.2** successfully implemented expense logging with AI extraction, creating the transactions table schema and complete expense flow with confirmation pattern. [`docs/stories/3.2.expense-logging-with-ai-extraction.md`](./3.2.expense-logging-with-ai-extraction.md)
- **AI Infrastructure Ready**: The `convex/rorkIntegration.ts` module provides `processText(text, language, context)` which returns structured AI responses. [`docs/stories/3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md`](./3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md)
- **Function Calling Defined**: The `log_expense` function definition exists in `convex/prompts/functions.ts` - need to add `log_income` function for income detection. [`docs/stories/3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md`](./3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md)
- **Confirmation Pattern**: Story 3.2 established the two-step confirmation flow: AI extraction ‚Üí User confirmation ‚Üí Database commit. [`docs/stories/3.2.expense-logging-with-ai-extraction.md`](./3.2.expense-logging-with-ai-extraction.md)
- **Bilingual Support**: All error messages and prompts must support Arabic and English based on user's `languagePreference`. [`docs/stories/3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md`](./3.1.rork-toolkit-api-integration.md)
- **Transactions Table**: Already created in Story 3.2 with fields: `userId`, `accountId`, `type`, `amount`, `description`, `category`, `date`, `isDeleted`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [`docs/stories/3.2.expense-logging-with-ai-extraction.md`](./3.2.expense-logging-with-ai-extraction.md)

### Data Models

**Existing Models to Use**:
- **Transactions Table**: Already created with `type` field supporting `"expense"` and `"income"` values. [Source: `convex/schema.ts` from Story 3.2]
- **User Model**: Provides `languagePreference` ("ar" | "en") for bilingual responses. [Source: `convex/schema.ts`]
- **Account Model**: Provides `balance`, `currency`, `isDefault` for transaction processing. [Source: `convex/schema.ts`]

### API Specifications

**Existing Convex Functions to Extend**:

1. **`convex/transactions.ts:createTransaction`** (mutation) - ALREADY EXISTS
   - **Purpose**: Atomically create transaction and update account balance
   - **Arguments**: `userId`, `accountId`, `type`, `amount`, `description`, `category`, `date`
   - **Current Status**: Supports both "expense" and "income" types from Story 3.2
   - **Returns**: `{ transactionId, newBalance }`
   - [Source: `docs/stories/3.2.expense-logging-with-ai-extraction.md`]

2. **`convex/expenseActions.ts`** - TO BE EXTENDED
   - **Current**: Contains `processExpenseWithAI` for expense handling
   - **New**: Add `processIncomeWithAI` function for income handling
   - **Pattern**: Follow same confirmation flow as expense processing
   - [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`]

3. **`convex/messageProcessor.ts`** - TO BE EXTENDED
   - **Current**: Routes expense intents to `processExpenseWithAI`
   - **New**: Add routing for income intents to `processIncomeWithAI`
   - **Pattern**: Use same intent detection and routing pattern
   - [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`]

### Component Specifications

**File Locations**: Based on current Convex structure:
- **Main Logic**: `convex/expenseActions.ts` (rename or extend for income)
- **AI Prompts**: `convex/prompts/system.ts` and `convex/prompts/functions.ts`
- **Message Routing**: `convex/messageProcessor.ts`
- **Database Schema**: `convex/schema.ts` (already has transactions table)
- [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`]

**Income Keywords**: 
- **English**: "received", "earned", "got paid", "salary", "income", "bonus", "refund"
- **Arabic**: "ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÑŸÖÿ™", "ÿ≠ÿµŸÑÿ™ ÿπŸÑŸâ", "ÿ±ÿßÿ™ÿ®", "ŸÖŸÉÿßŸÅÿ£ÿ©", "ÿØÿÆŸÑ"
- [Source: `docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`]

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing**: 
- Test income intent detection with various phrasings
- Test amount extraction from natural language
- Test balance increment (opposite of expense decrement)
- Test bilingual keyword detection
- [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Testing Standards]

**Integration Testing**:
- Test complete flow: User message ‚Üí AI processing ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Database update
- Test error handling for missing amounts
- Test account balance updates
- [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`]

### Technical Constraints

**Balance Consistency**: Account balance updates MUST happen in the same transaction as creating transaction records (atomic operation). [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Critical Rule #3]

**User Data Isolation**: All queries MUST filter by `userId` to prevent cross-user data access. [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Critical Rule #1]

**Type Safety**: All Convex function arguments MUST use strict validators (`v.id()`, `v.string()`, etc.). [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Critical Rule #2]

**AI Confirmation Pattern**: Always present AI-extracted data to user for confirmation before committing to database. [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Critical Rule #5]

**Bilingual Support**: All user-facing messages must be provided in both Arabic and English based on user's language preference. [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Critical Rule #6]
