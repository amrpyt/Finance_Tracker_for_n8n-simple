# Story 3.1: Rork Toolkit API Integration

## Status

**Approved**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** Convex functions to call Rork Toolkit API for natural language understanding,
**so that** the bot can intelligently interpret user messages.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Rork Toolkit API credentials loaded from `config.api.json` or environment variables [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
2. Convex action `callRorkAPI` created to send messages to Rork LLM endpoint [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
3. API request includes system prompt defining bot's role and capabilities [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
4. API response parsed to extract structured data (intent, entities, confidence) [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
5. Error handling for API failures (timeout, rate limit, invalid response) with retry logic [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)
6. API call latency logged for performance monitoring [`docs/prd/epic-3-transactions.md`](../prd/epic-3-transactions.md)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- **Story 2.5** implemented balance inquiry using intent detection patterns in `bot/src/handlers/messages.ts`. The new AI integration will replace keyword-based detection with Rork AI-powered natural language understanding. [`docs/stories/2.5.instant-balance-check.md`](./2.5.instant-balance-check.md)
- **Story 2.1-2.3** established the account management flow and bilingual message patterns. The AI system prompt must understand both Arabic and English for transaction extraction. [`docs/stories/2.1.Account-Creation-via-Natural-Language.md`](./2.1.Account-Creation-via-Natural-Language.md)
- **Story 1.4** created the user registration flow with `languagePreference` stored in the database. The AI prompt should adapt responses based on user language. [`docs/stories/1.4.user-registration-profile-creation.md`](./1.4.user-registration-profile-creation.md)

### Data Models

- **No new database tables required** for this story. The AI integration layer will be stateless and call existing Convex queries/mutations. [`docs/architecture.md#Data Models`](../architecture.md)
- **User model** provides `languagePreference` ("ar" | "en") which should be passed to AI for context-aware responses. [`docs/architecture.md#User Model`](../architecture.md)
- **Transaction model** defines the structure that AI must extract: `type`, `amount`, `description`, `category`, `accountId`. [`docs/architecture.md#Transaction Model`](../architecture.md)

### API Specifications

- **Rork Toolkit API endpoint**: `https://toolkit.rork.com/text/llm/` (POST) with average response time of 2200ms. [`config.api.json`](../../config.api.json)
- **Rate limits**: Recommended 60 requests/minute, max 5 concurrent requests. [`config.api.json`](../../config.api.json)
- **Retry configuration**: Max 3 retries, 1000ms backoff, 5000ms timeout. [`config.api.json`](../../config.api.json)
- **API Key**: Must be loaded from environment variable `RORK_API_KEY` (not hardcoded). [`docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#External Service Requirements`](../architecture/tech-stack.md)
- **Function calling protocol**: Rork API supports structured function calling to route intents to specific Convex mutations/queries. [`docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Architectural Patterns`](../architecture/high-level-architecture.md)

### Component Specifications

- **Create `convex/ai.ts`**: Main AI integration file containing Rork API client and actions. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Convex Backend`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **Create `convex/lib/rork.ts`**: Reusable Rork API client with retry logic and error handling. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Convex Backend`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **Create `convex/prompts/system.ts`**: System prompt defining bot's role, capabilities, and response format. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Convex Backend`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **Create `convex/prompts/functions.ts`**: Function calling definitions for intent routing (expense, income, balance, etc.). [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Convex Backend`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **Convex Actions** (not queries/mutations): AI calls are external HTTP requests and must use Convex actions. [`docs/architecture.md#API Specification`](../architecture.md)

### Agentic Design Principles

- **Autonomous Intent Recognition**: AI should infer user intent without explicit keywords. Support ambiguous queries like "I spent money today" without requiring exact patterns.
- **Context-Aware Reasoning**: AI should remember conversation context (via session) and make intelligent assumptions (e.g., if user says "another coffee", infer same category/amount as last transaction).
- **Proactive Clarification**: When information is missing or ambiguous, AI should ask targeted follow-up questions rather than failing (e.g., "Which account?" if user has multiple).
- **Adaptive Learning**: AI should learn from user corrections. If user corrects a category, store preference for similar descriptions in future.
- **Multi-Step Planning**: For complex requests like "show me how much I spent on food this week", AI should break down into: 1) identify date range, 2) filter by category, 3) sum amounts, 4) format response.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If AI confidence is low (<70%), present multiple interpretations for user to choose rather than guessing wrong.

### File Locations

- **`convex/ai.ts`**: Main entry point for AI integration. Export `processUserMessage` action. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **`convex/lib/rork.ts`**: HTTP client wrapper for Rork API with retry logic. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **`convex/lib/errors.ts`**: Extend existing error classes for AI-specific errors (API timeout, rate limit, invalid response). [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **`convex/prompts/system.ts`**: System prompt text (bilingual support, financial domain context). [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **`convex/prompts/functions.ts`**: Function definitions for structured AI responses. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **`config.api.json`**: Already exists with Rork API configuration. No changes needed. [`config.api.json`](../../config.api.json)

### Testing Requirements

- **Testing framework**: Vitest for Convex functions (not Jest). [`docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing`](../architecture/tech-stack.md)
- **Test file location**: `convex/tests/ai.test.ts` for AI action tests. [`docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy`](../architecture.md)
- **Coverage target**: 80%+ for business logic in Convex functions. [`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Test Coverage Requirements`](../architecture/coding-standards.md)
- **Key test scenarios**:
  - Mock Rork API responses for expense/income extraction
  - Test retry logic on API failures (timeout, 500 errors)
  - Verify rate limiting enforcement (max 5 concurrent, 60/min)
  - Test bilingual prompt handling (Arabic and English)
  - Validate structured response parsing (intent, entities, confidence)
  - Test error handling for malformed API responses
- **Integration testing**: Manual testing with real Rork API using sample prompts in Convex dashboard. [`docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy`](../architecture.md)

### Technical Constraints

- **Response time target**: Sub-2-second total response time. Rork API averages 2200ms, so minimize sequential calls. [`docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md`](../architecture/high-level-architecture.md)
- **Convex Actions**: Must use `action` (not `query` or `mutation`) for external HTTP calls. Actions cannot directly access the database—use `ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation` to call other functions. [`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules`](../architecture/coding-standards.md)
- **Error messages**: All user-facing errors must be bilingual (Arabic/English). [`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Error Messages in User's Language`](../architecture/coding-standards.md)
- **No secrets in code**: API key must be loaded from environment variable `RORK_API_KEY`, never hardcoded. [`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Security Standards`](../architecture/coding-standards.md)
- **Retry logic**: Implement exponential backoff (1000ms base) with max 3 retries for transient failures. [`config.api.json`](../../config.api.json)
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with anonymized user data for debugging. Log API latency for performance monitoring. [`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Logging Standards`](../architecture/coding-standards.md)

### Agentic Behavior Requirements

- **Conversation Memory**: Pass last 3-5 messages as context to AI for continuity (e.g., "the same" refers to previous transaction).
  - **Storage Approach**: Conversation history should be managed by bot server's `SessionManager` (in-memory) and passed as parameter to `processUserMessage` action. No database storage required for MVP. [`docs/stories/2.5.instant-balance-check.md`](./2.5.instant-balance-check.md)
  - **History Format**: Array of message objects with `{ role: "user" | "assistant", content: string, timestamp: number }`
  - **Retention**: Keep last 3-5 messages per user session, automatically pruned on session timeout
- **Confidence Thresholds**:
  - High confidence (>85%): Execute immediately after confirmation
  - Medium confidence (70-85%): Present interpretation with "Did you mean...?"
  - Low confidence (<70%): Ask clarifying question with multiple choice options
- **Smart Defaults**: AI should infer missing data intelligently:
  - No account specified → Use default account
  - No category → Infer from description (e.g., "Uber" → Transportation)
  - No date → Assume "today"
  - Ambiguous amount → Ask for clarification (never guess)
- **Tool Selection**: AI should autonomously choose which Convex function to call based on intent (query for read, mutation for write, action for external calls).
- **Error Recovery**: If AI misinterprets, user correction should trigger re-processing with updated context, not require starting over.

### Project Structure Notes

- **Convex limitations**: Convex functions use relative imports (no path aliases). Import as `./lib/rork` not `@/lib/rork`. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Import Path Conventions`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **File naming**: Use camelCase for TypeScript files (`rork.ts`, not `rork-client.ts`). [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#File Naming Conventions`](../architecture/source-tree.md)
- **Prompts directory**: Create new `convex/prompts/` directory for system prompts and function definitions. [`docs/architecture/source-tree.md#Convex Backend`](../architecture/source-tree.md)

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary:**
- Successfully implemented all 6 acceptance criteria
- Created comprehensive Rork API client with exponential backoff retry logic (max 3 retries, 1000ms base)
- Implemented bilingual error handling (Arabic/English) for all AI-specific errors
- Built agentic system prompts with context-awareness and multi-step reasoning capabilities
- Created structured function calling definitions for 6 intents: log_expense, log_income, check_balance, list_accounts, search_transactions, ask_clarification
- Implemented `processUserMessage` action with performance monitoring and structured logging
- Added `testAI` action for manual testing in Convex dashboard
- Created comprehensive unit tests with 80%+ coverage including retry logic, error handling, and agentic behavior scenarios

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Retry Strategy**: Implemented exponential backoff with configurable max retries (3) and base delay (1000ms) per config.api.json
2. **Confidence Thresholds**: High (>85%) = execute, Medium (70-85%) = confirm, Low (<70%) = clarify
3. **Context Enrichment**: System prompt includes user language, recent transactions (last 3), and conversation history (last 3-5 messages)
4. **Error Handling**: All errors are bilingual AppError instances with user-friendly messages
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Structured logging with API latency, total latency, and slow response warnings (>3000ms)
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Transactions query returns empty array until Story 3.2+ implements full transaction management

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests use Vitest with mocked fetch for Rork API calls
- Tests cover: successful calls, retry logic (500 errors, timeouts, rate limits), error handling (4xx, missing API key, invalid responses), and agentic behaviors (ambiguous input, context awareness, multi-step reasoning, bilingual support)
- Manual integration testing available via `testAI` action in Convex dashboard

**Deviations from Story:**
- None. All acceptance criteria met as specified.
