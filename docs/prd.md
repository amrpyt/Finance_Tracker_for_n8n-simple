## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to track personal finances through natural conversation in Telegram without installing dedicated apps
- Reduce daily finance tracking time from 5-10 minutes to under 30 seconds per transaction
- Provide AI-powered natural language understanding in Arabic and English with 85%+ transaction categorization accuracy
- Track multiple financial accounts (bank accounts, cash, credit cards) with real-time balance visibility
- Monitor loans lent to friends/family with payment tracking to prevent financial leakage
- Achieve AI agent response time under 2 seconds for all user interactions
- Reach 1,000 active users within 3 months with 60% weekly engagement and 40% 30-day retention rate

### Background Context

Traditional personal finance apps create friction through complex UIs, mandatory installations, and lack of Arabic language support, resulting in 70% of users abandoning them within a month. Arabic-speaking individuals particularly lack quality financial tools that fit their cultural context and daily habits. This solution delivers a Telegram-based personal financial assistant that meets users where they already are‚Äîin their messaging app‚Äîusing AI to understand natural language inputs and automatically categorize transactions. Users can log expenses in 5 seconds through simple chat messages like "ÿØŸÅÿπÿ™ 50 ÿ¨ŸÜŸäŸá ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÇŸáŸàÿ©" (I paid 50 pounds for coffee). The system specifically addresses the informal loan tracking problem common in Middle Eastern cultures where lending money to friends and family is frequent but poorly tracked, helping users recover outstanding loans and maintain financial awareness.

---

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

A completely conversational interface where users interact with the bot as if chatting with a financial assistant. No buttons, forms, or menus‚Äîpure natural language interaction. The bot should feel intelligent, helpful, and non-judgmental about spending habits. Responses should be concise (1-3 sentences) to match messaging app conventions, with emoji usage for visual clarity (üí∞ for money, üìä for reports, ‚úÖ for confirmations).

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Natural Language First:** Users type freely without learning commands or syntax
- **Confirmation Pattern:** Bot extracts intent, presents interpretation, asks for confirmation before committing changes
- **Contextual Awareness:** Bot remembers recent conversation context (e.g., "add another 20" after logging expense)
- **Proactive Feedback:** Bot provides immediate balance updates after transactions
- **Error Recovery:** If bot misunderstands, user can simply rephrase or type "no" to cancel

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the critical interaction flows are:

- **Welcome/Onboarding Flow:** First-time user greeting with quick tutorial examples
- **Transaction Logging Flow:** User input ‚Üí AI extraction ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Balance update
- **Balance Check Flow:** User query ‚Üí Account summary display
- **Loan Creation Flow:** User input ‚Üí Borrower/amount extraction ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Loan record created
- **Loan Payment Flow:** User input ‚Üí Loan selection ‚Üí Payment amount ‚Üí Updated balance
- **Transaction History View:** List of recent transactions with dates, amounts, descriptions
- **Account Management Flow:** Create/rename/view accounts

### Accessibility: None

MVP focuses on core functionality. Accessibility features (screen reader support, high contrast) deferred to post-MVP.

### Branding

Minimal branding. Bot should feel professional yet friendly. Use clear, simple language. Emoji usage for visual hierarchy (üí∞ money, üè¶ bank, üë§ person for loans, üìÖ dates). No custom graphics or complex styling‚Äîrely on Telegram's native message formatting (bold, italic, code blocks).

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Telegram (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop). The bot must work seamlessly across all Telegram platforms with no platform-specific features. Responsive to any device that runs Telegram.

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository with two main directories:
- `/convex` - Backend functions, database schema, AI integration
- `/bot` - Telegram bot server (Node.js or Python)

### Service Architecture

**Hybrid Architecture:**
- **Telegram Bot Server:** Lightweight Node.js/Python server handling Telegram webhook or polling
- **Convex Backend:** Serverless TypeScript functions for business logic, database operations, and AI calls
- **Communication:** Bot server calls Convex via HTTP Actions or Convex Client SDK
- **AI Integration:** Convex functions call Rork Toolkit API for natural language processing

**Rationale:** This architecture leverages Convex's strengths (real-time database, serverless scaling) while keeping bot logic separate for easier testing and potential multi-platform expansion (WhatsApp, etc.).

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing:**
- **Unit Tests:** Core business logic in Convex functions (transaction creation, balance calculation, loan tracking)
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end flows from Telegram message ‚Üí AI processing ‚Üí Database update ‚Üí Response
- **Manual Testing:** Natural language understanding accuracy requires human validation with diverse Arabic/English inputs
- **Test Data:** Create sample user profiles with realistic transaction patterns for regression testing

**Rationale:** AI-driven systems require both automated testing for logic and manual testing for language understanding quality.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Language/Runtime:** TypeScript for Convex functions, Node.js (TypeScript) or Python for bot server
- **Bot Framework:** `node-telegram-bot-api` (Node.js) or `python-telegram-bot` (Python)
- **AI/LLM Provider:** Rork Toolkit API (existing config in `config.api.json`) - no OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Database:** Convex built-in database with JSON documents and relational model
- **Deployment:** Convex auto-deploys backend; bot server on free tier hosting (Railway, Render, or Fly.io)
- **Environment Variables:** Telegram Bot Token, Rork API credentials, Convex deployment URL
- **Error Handling:** Implement retry logic for AI API calls with exponential backoff
- **Logging:** Structured logging for debugging AI interpretation errors and transaction issues
- **Data Model:** Tables for `users`, `accounts`, `transactions`, `loans`, `loan_payments`
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement per-user rate limits to prevent spam (max 10 transactions/minute)
- **Localization:** Store user language preference (Arabic/English) in user profile for consistent responses
- **Currency:** Default to Egyptian Pounds (EGP) for MVP; currency symbol detection from user input

3. Convex query filters transactions by date range
4. Response includes date range in header (e.g., "Transactions from 2025-09-01 to 2025-09-30:")
5. Total expenses and income for period calculated and displayed
6. Net change (income - expenses) shown at end
7. Handles relative dates (today, yesterday, last week, this month) and absolute dates (2025-09-15)

### Story 5.3: Edit Transaction Details

**As a** user,  
**I want** to correct a transaction if I made a mistake,  
**so that** my financial records are accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Convex mutation `updateTransaction` accepts transaction ID and updated fields (amount, description, category)
2. Bot responds to commands like "edit transaction 3" or "change last transaction"
3. Bot displays current transaction details and asks what to change
4. User can specify new amount, description, or category
5. Account balance adjusted to reflect the change (difference between old and new amount)
6. Confirmation message shows old and new values (e.g., "Updated: 50 EGP ‚Üí 55 EGP for 'coffee'")
7. Edit timestamp logged for audit trail

### Story 5.4: Delete Transaction

**As a** user,  
**I want** to delete a transaction if it was logged incorrectly,  
**so that** my records don't include erroneous data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Convex mutation `deleteTransaction` accepts transaction ID and marks as deleted (soft delete)
2. Bot responds to commands like "delete transaction 5" or "remove last transaction"
3. Bot displays transaction details and asks for confirmation before deleting
4. On confirmation, transaction marked as deleted (not physically removed from database)
5. Account balance adjusted to reverse the transaction
6. Confirmation message sent (e.g., "‚úÖ Deleted: 50 EGP for 'coffee'. Balance updated to 3000 EGP")
7. Deleted transactions excluded from history views but retained in database for audit

### Story 5.5: Transaction Search by Description

**As a** user,  
**I want** to search for transactions by keyword,  
**so that** I can quickly find specific expenses or income.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Convex query `searchTransactions` accepts search term and filters by description
2. Bot responds to commands like "find coffee transactions" or "ÿßÿ®ÿ≠ÿ´ ÿπŸÜ ŸÖŸàÿßÿµŸÑÿßÿ™"
3. Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matches
4. Results formatted as numbered list with date, amount, description, account
5. Result count displayed (e.g., "Found 5 transactions matching 'coffee':")
6. Empty result handled (e.g., "No transactions found matching 'coffee'")
7. Search works in both Arabic and English

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review the PRD's User Interface Design Goals section and create a comprehensive UX architecture document. Focus on conversational design patterns, error handling flows, and user confirmation mechanisms. Ensure the design supports both Arabic and English users with culturally appropriate interaction patterns.

### Architect Prompt

Using this PRD as input, create a detailed technical architecture document. Define the Convex schema, API structure, bot server architecture, Rork Toolkit API integration patterns, and deployment strategy. Ensure the architecture supports the NFRs (sub-2-second response time, 85%+ AI accuracy, 99.5% uptime) and scales within Convex free tier constraints for initial 100 users.
