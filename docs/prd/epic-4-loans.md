**As a** user,  
**I want** loans to automatically close when fully repaid,  
**so that** my active loan list stays clean.

### Acceptance Criteria

4. Paid loans excluded from active loan list but retained in database for history
5. User can manually mark loan as paid via command like "mark Ahmed loan as paid"
