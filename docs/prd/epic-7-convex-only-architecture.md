# Epic 7: Convex-Only Architecture (Serverless Simplification)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Epic ID:** Epic 7  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-10-04)

---

## Overview

Simplify the architecture by **removing Trigger.dev entirely** and implementing all functionality directly in Convex. This epic eliminates external orchestration dependencies, reduces architectural complexity, and maintains identical user functionality while being easier to maintain, deploy, and debug.

**Supersedes:** Epic 6 (Trigger.dev Architecture) - Proven unnecessary after analysis

### Architecture Evolution

- **Epic 1-5:** Telegram → Bot Server → Convex → RORK
- **Epic 6:** Telegram → Convex HTTP Action → Trigger.dev (13 Tasks) → Convex + RORK *(Implemented but overcomplicated)*
- **Epic 7:** Telegram → Convex HTTP Action → Convex Actions → Convex DB + External APIs ✅ **CURRENT**

## Goals

- ✅ **Eliminate External Dependencies:** Remove Trigger.dev platform and deployment
- ✅ **Reduce Architectural Complexity:** Single platform (Convex) instead of two
- ✅ **Simplify Deployment:** One command (`npx convex deploy`) instead of two platforms
- ✅ **Maintain Feature Parity:** All existing bot functionality preserved
- ✅ **Enhance Capabilities:** Add chart generation using QuickChart API
- ✅ **Reduce Costs:** Eliminate Trigger.dev platform costs
- ✅ **Improve Developer Experience:** Single-platform debugging and monitoring

---

## Scope

---

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components

**Convex HTTP Action (`telegram.ts`):**
- Receives Telegram webhook events
- Validates requests and handles idempotency
- Routes to message processor
- Returns <200ms acknowledgment

**Convex Actions (Business Logic):**
- `messageProcessor.ts` - Main routing with AI integration
- `expenseActions.ts` - Expense/income processing with parsing
- `balanceActions.ts` - Balance checking with multi-account support
- `chartGenerator.ts` - Chart generation using QuickChart API *(NEW)*
- `telegramAPI.ts` - Telegram Bot API integration
- `rorkIntegration.ts` - AI processing with RORK
- `userProfiles.ts` - User management and preferences
- `accountActions.ts` - Account management

**External API Integrations:**
- **RORK API:** Natural language understanding (free)
- **Telegram Bot API:** Message sending and bot interactions
- **QuickChart API:** Chart image generation (free)

### Key Improvements Over Epic 6

| Aspect | Epic 6 (Trigger.dev) | Epic 7 (Convex-Only) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Platforms** | Convex + Trigger.dev | Convex only |
| **Tasks/Actions** | 13 Trigger.dev tasks | 8 Convex actions |
| **Deployment** | 2 platforms, 2 commands | 1 platform, 1 command |
| **Monitoring** | Split across platforms | Unified in Convex |
| **Cost** | $20-50/month | $0 (free tier) |
| **Complexity** | High (orchestration) | Low (direct calls) |
| **Features** | Core functionality | Core + Charts |

## Risks & Mitigations

### Identified Risks

1. **Performance Degradation**
   - *Risk:* Direct processing slower than Trigger.dev orchestration
   - *Mitigation:* ✅ Maintained <200ms webhook response, <2s total processing
   - *Status:* No degradation observed

2. **Loss of Retry Capabilities**
   - *Risk:* Trigger.dev provided built-in retry logic
   - *Mitigation:* ✅ Implemented error handling and retry in Convex actions
   - *Status:* Robust error handling in place

3. **Debugging Difficulty**
   - *Risk:* Less sophisticated debugging than Trigger.dev dashboard
   - *Mitigation:* ✅ Comprehensive logging in Convex, simpler single-platform debugging
   - *Status:* Actually easier to debug

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Arise

1. **Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes):**
   - Revert to Epic 6 Git commit
   - Redeploy Trigger.dev tasks
   - Update Telegram webhook URL
   - Re-enable Trigger.dev task delegation

2. **Data Preservation:**
   - No database changes made - all data intact
   - User sessions unaffected
   - Transaction history preserved

3. **Rollback Trigger Criteria:**
   - >10% error rate in production
   - Response time >5s for standard operations
   - Data integrity issues
   - Critical feature failures

**Status:** ✅ No rollback needed - Epic 7 stable in production
