---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to track personal finances through natural conversation in Telegram without installing dedicated apps
- Reduce daily finance tracking time from 5-10 minutes to under 30 seconds per transaction
- Provide AI-powered natural language understanding in Arabic and English with 85%+ transaction categorization accuracy
- Track multiple financial accounts (bank accounts, cash, credit cards) with real-time balance visibility
- Monitor loans lent to friends/family with payment tracking to prevent financial leakage
- Achieve AI agent response time under 2 seconds for all user interactions
- Reach 1,000 active users within 3 months with 60% weekly engagement and 40% 30-day retention rate

### Background Context

Traditional personal finance apps create friction through complex UIs, mandatory installations, and lack of Arabic language support, resulting in 70% of users abandoning them within a month. Arabic-speaking individuals particularly lack quality financial tools that fit their cultural context and daily habits. This solution delivers a Telegram-based personal financial assistant that meets users where they already are—in their messaging app—using AI to understand natural language inputs and automatically categorize transactions. Users can log expenses in 5 seconds through simple chat messages like "دفعت 50 جنيه على القهوة" (I paid 50 pounds for coffee). The system specifically addresses the informal loan tracking problem common in Middle Eastern cultures where lending money to friends and family is frequent but poorly tracked, helping users recover outstanding loans and maintain financial awareness.
