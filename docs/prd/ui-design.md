## Overall UX Vision

A completely conversational interface where users interact with the bot as if chatting with a financial assistant. No buttons, forms, or menus—pure natural language interaction. The bot should feel intelligent, helpful, and non-judgmental about spending habits. Responses should be concise (1-3 sentences) to match messaging app conventions, with emoji usage for visual clarity (💰 for money, 📊 for reports, ✅ for confirmations).

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Natural Language First:** Users type freely without learning commands or syntax
- **Confirmation Pattern:** Bot extracts intent, presents interpretation, asks for confirmation before committing changes
- **Contextual Awareness:** Bot remembers recent conversation context (e.g., "add another 20" after logging expense)
- **Proactive Feedback:** Bot provides immediate balance updates after transactions
- **Error Recovery:** If bot misunderstands, user can simply rephrase or type "no" to cancel

---

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the critical interaction flows are:

- **Welcome/Onboarding Flow:** First-time user greeting with quick tutorial examples
- **Transaction Logging Flow:** User input → AI extraction → Confirmation → Balance update
- **Balance Check Flow:** User query → Account summary display
- **Loan Creation Flow:** User input → Borrower/amount extraction → Confirmation → Loan record created
- **Loan Payment Flow:** User input → Loan selection → Payment amount → Updated balance
- **Transaction History View:** List of recent transactions with dates, amounts, descriptions
- **Account Management Flow:** Create/rename/view accounts

## Accessibility

MVP focuses on core functionality. Accessibility features (screen reader support, high contrast) deferred to post-MVP.

---

## Branding

Minimal branding. Bot should feel professional yet friendly. Use clear, simple language. Emoji usage for visual hierarchy (💰 money, 🏦 bank, 👤 person for loans, 📅 dates). No custom graphics or complex styling—rely on Telegram's native message formatting (bold, italic, code blocks).

---

## Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive**

Telegram (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop). The bot must work seamlessly across all Telegram platforms with no platform-specific features. Responsive to any device that runs Telegram.
