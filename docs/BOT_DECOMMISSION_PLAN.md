# Bot Server Decommission Plan

**Story:** 6.3 Business Logic Migration and Bot Decommission  
**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Owner:** James (Dev)

## Overview

Complete migration of all business logic from the Node.js bot server to Trigger.dev tasks. The bot server can now be safely decommissioned as all functionality has been migrated to the new serverless architecture.

## Migration Status

### ✅ Completed Migrations

**Webhook Handling**
- ✅ Telegram webhook reception → Convex HTTP Action
- ✅ Fast acknowledgment (<200ms) → Convex response
- ✅ Task delegation → Trigger.dev webhook processor

**Message Processing** 
- ✅ Message routing → Enhanced message handler with AI
- ✅ Intent detection → RORK API integration via Trigger.dev
- ✅ Command handling → Dedicated command handler task
- ✅ Callback queries → Dedicated callback handler task

**Business Logic**
- ✅ Expense logging → `expense:add` task with validation
- ✅ Balance checking → `balance:check` task with multi-account support
- ✅ User state management → Convex database integration
- ✅ Confirmation flows → Task-based state handling

**External Integrations**
- ✅ RORK AI calls → Trigger.dev `rork:test` task
- ✅ Telegram Bot API → Dedicated API tasks (`telegram:send`, etc.)
- ✅ Database operations → Convex integration tasks

**Infrastructure**
- ✅ Error handling → Comprehensive error management across all tasks
- ✅ Retry logic → Robust retry strategies per task type
- ✅ Observability → Full logging, tags, and performance metrics
- ✅ Concurrency control → Per-user concurrency keys

## Decommission Checklist

### Phase 1: Pre-Decommission Validation ✅

- [x] **All Tasks Deployed** - Version 20251003.4 with 13 tasks
- [x] **End-to-End Testing** - Complete flow from webhook to response
- [x] **Performance Validation** - Sub-200ms webhook acknowledgment
- [x] **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management verified
- [x] **User Experience** - All Epic 1-3 behaviors working

### Phase 2: Production Validation (48-72h) 🔄

- [ ] **Traffic Monitoring** - Observe production webhook traffic for 48+ hours
- [ ] **Error Rate Analysis** - Ensure <1% error rate on critical paths
- [ ] **Performance Metrics** - Confirm response times within targets
- [ ] **User Feedback** - No critical user-reported issues
- [ ] **Feature Regression Testing** - All original functionality intact

### Phase 3: Bot Server Shutdown (Post-Validation) ⏳

- [ ] **Service Shutdown** - Stop bot server process gracefully
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup** - Remove server resources and configurations
- [ ] **Code Archive** - Archive bot server code for reference
- [ ] **Documentation Update** - Update deployment and architecture docs
- [ ] **Final Validation** - Confirm system operates without bot server

## Rollback Plan

### Emergency Rollback (If Issues Discovered)

**Immediate Actions (<10 minutes)**
1. **Revert Webhook URL** - Point back to bot server endpoint
2. **Restart Bot Server** - Restore original bot server functionality  
3. **Monitor Recovery** - Verify system stability restored

**Rollback Triggers**
- Critical functionality broken for >15 minutes
- Error rate >5% on essential operations
- Complete service unavailability 
- User-reported data loss or corruption

**Rollback Assets**
- Bot server code preserved in `/bot` directory
- Original webhook URLs documented
- Environment configurations backed up
- Database schema unchanged (compatible with both systems)

## Risk Assessment

### Migration Risks: LOW ✅

**Mitigated Risks**
- ✅ **Functionality Loss** - All features migrated and tested
- ✅ **Performance Degradation** - Performance improved vs bot server
- ✅ **Data Loss** - Database unchanged, compatible with both systems
