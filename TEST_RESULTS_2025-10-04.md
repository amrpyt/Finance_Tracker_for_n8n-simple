## User Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

**Open Telegram and send these messages to @FinanceTracker_coderaai_bot:**

1. `/start`
   - Expected: Welcome message with language buttons

## Performance Targets

| Operation | Target | How to Verify |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Webhook Response | <200ms | Convex logs |
| Expense Logging | <2s | User experience |
| Balance Check | <1s | User experience |
| Chart Generation | <3s | User experience |

---

## Known Considerations

### RORK AI Integration
- **Status:** Deployed but untested
- **Fallback:** Keyword detection if RORK times out
- **Expected:** May be slow on first call (cold start)

### QuickChart API
- **Status:** Integrated but untested
- **Free Tier:** Should work for testing
- **Expected:** Chart URLs should be generated successfully

### New User Flow
- **Status:** May need account auto-creation
- **Fallback:** Error message prompting user to create account
- **Expected:** First expense should trigger account creation
